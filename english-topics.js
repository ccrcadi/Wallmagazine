    title: "The God Particle",
    story: `
    The Higgs Boson is one of the most important unanswered mysteries in the realm of physics. Theoretically, it is said to be a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, but deep down, it has some extraordinary characteristics, which might play a vital role in unraveling several unknown secrets of physics, particularly particle physics. The first research regarding the Higgs Boson had been conducted at CERN in the 1960s. From then, several experiments were carried out by scientists and organisations. all over the world. Finally, after 40 years of extensive research, in 2012, from several experiments carried out by the CMS and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, a sub atomic particle with the expected properties similar to Higgs Boson was discovered. For this discovery, in 2013, physicists Peter Higgs and Francois Englert were awarded the Nobel prize in physics. Now lets look into the characteristics and properties of the Higgs Boson. Its mass has been measured 125 giga electron volts approximately, which is similar to the predictions of the Standard Model. Now another question arises that, what is the standard Model? In physics, the Standard Model is a widely accepted frame work ,based on quantum field theory, that predicts almost all known particles and forces aside from gravity with great accuracy. In the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is actually a massive scalar boson. Its special characteristics include:
•Zero Spin
•Even parity (positive) 
•No electric charge
•No colour charge
Another mentionable property includes that the Higgs Boson is a very unstable particle, which decays very quickly into various particles like pairs of photons, W and Z bosons, fermions etc. In the PRL papers written in 1964, Peter Higgs also mentioned in the closing sentence that, "An essential feature is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons". Before these discoveries, in the 1980s, there arose a question among the then physicists about the existence of a field named the Higgs field, on which the Standard Model was based on. So, during that time, this issue about the existence of the Higgs field become the last unverified part of the standard Model, which was considered as "The central problem in particle physics" for several decades. After decades of extensive research, the scientists gave several key predictions, among which, one was that a matching particle, called the "Higgs Boson" should also exist, whose existence would have also proved the existence of the Higgs field was theorised as a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components, having a Sombrero potential unlike any other fields. The significance of the discovery of the Higgs Boson is immense. It includes: 

•Cosmic Inflation
•Authenticity of the Standard Model
•Proof of the scalar fields like Higgs field 
•Symmetry breaking.
Although still theoretical, the discovery of the, Higgs Boson is a milestone in the realm of particle physics. Through this discovery, a way has been paved for the scientists to explore more about the funda mental structure of the universe and answer that un solved mysteries of physics. Following this discovery, through further extensive search and experiments, many new theories and discoveries will be ab- le to present a more comprehensible and advanced explanation regarding several matters of physics and cosmology to mankind.

    story: `
    Are some people meant to suffer?
 Living out like a loser
Can’t they rise again?
 To bargain
What was taken away from them

They were the dreamers
Dreaming like a new comer 
With hundreds of possibilities, 
Dreamt a new kid
 But seeing the truth of life 
He closed his eyelids.

Those eyelids never opened again 
Because life didn't give him
 What he chose to gain
They said they accepted beauty
But never accepted dreams of every nature
Although they say,
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.

Alas! they didn't have eyes
For which they had to hide the kid
Under their lies.

They didn't have eyes
That's why they didn't have to close their eyelids 
But, was it the fault of the new kid?
Choosing something out of their bid?

    title: "The Stubborn Pawn",
    story: `
    The black and white pieces were glimmering in the spotlight. Though the setup of the board was clear as day, it was still shrouded in a mist of mystery. Afterall Chess was something new to Digonto. So, his perplexity at the sight of this obscure game as a birthday present wasn't quite inexplicable Digonto Faced his father and immediately spat up, "What is this, Dad ? Reza Ahmed, Digonto's father who bought him the chessboard for his 8th birthday, replied, This is a chessboard. You can play this game with your friends. and even with me sometimes !" As a keen learner, Digonto was eager to play new games He immediately learned the rules of the game from his father.
Day after day, Digonto played chess with his friends. The aspect about the game that intrigued him most was its characters. All pieces on the board served to protect the king. The queen, arguably the strongest. Travels throughout the board and causes havoc. The Dishop and rook bore contrasting traits; with one moving diagonally and the later one travelling sidew- ays. The Knight was capable of jumping over other pieces on the board. But the pieces that bored him the most were the pawns. He simply could not fathom the necessity of this rather useless piece.
Once Digonto grew confident in chess, he would Challenge his father to matches. In the first few matches, he would see that his father would give away his pawn at vulnerable positions. Seizing the opportunity, he would strike the pawns out with glee. However, after a few moves, he would always be entrapped within a cleverly orchestrated setup of his father. His father would go on about the same topic every match, "You must know how to use the pawns cleverly. They're not meant to fight for themselves, sometimes you have to sacrifice them in order to win the game. But, as the game would progress, Reza would always have a smirk on his face, as he added, but never make the mistake of underestimating a pawn. Even pawns can go great ways. “You never know when a pawn might suddenly become so powerful that it might crush all you ever hoped for,” he said just as he'd slide a pawn to the last square and transform it into a queen.

As years passed by Digonto grew more mature. When he was about years old . he noticed that something was off with his father. He would spend late nights on the phone with his colleagues. Sometimes his bosses would call and he’d listen with a look of worry. Reza Ahmed worked as supply chain manager at Hots Eats restaurant. As the days went on Digonto would hardly find him home. He wondered how the restaurant business kept his father so busy. He was feeling suspicious about all this. In the midst of this mysterious saga, a phone call from a phone call from a stranger changed Digonto's life forever. His father was severely injured in a road accident! He immediately rushed to the hospital where Reza was taken, but just before he reached the room, his father breathed his last. At his funeral, Digonto felt traumatized. He'd lost his mother at a very young age, and now his father too.He couldn't- Just accept this reality. As he stood there in silence, a stranger approached him Digonte looked up and saw that the stranger had a piece of paper in his hand. The title written on that piece, in bold letters, read “HOT EATS OWNERS ACCUSED OF MONEY LAUNDERING,’ Handing him the piece, the stranger went away without saying another word. Though it took some time, everything became dear to Digonto. Now his father held a managerial position at Hot Eats. The owners must have used him to carry on their shady business. Reza Ahmed got a sniff of the dealings recently and, being an honest man, reported it to the police. His father didn't die in an accident, he was killed by the owners goons! And that stranger...he must have been a colleague of his father. Digonto understood everything now. The owners didn't have to think twice before killing off their powers. Digonto himself was a pawn in this game, with this life mercilessly shattered But he was not one to stay still. He had a new aim in mind, to avenge his father's death, and to do that, he'd go whatever lengths necessary.

25 years later, Digonto is now sitting in his office. He is playing chess with his rather young personal assistant. Well,old habits die hard. By now,Digonto has become a master at his game. On the board, there are a few pieces scattered here and there digonto has a pawn left. An employee enters his office and says, “Your Honor the hearing is due in an hour” ‘Which one, again?” asks Digonto .”That one about money laundering in some restaurant.” "OK. I'm coming” Digonto says, getting up, “But no before I finish this match ."As he slides his pawn into the last square,he lets out a huge laugh in the face of his assistant. "And as I said earlier even a pawn can become a queen !” The assistant was very familiar with this actually. You see, no one leaves the office of Justice Digonto Ahmed without losing a chess match.

    We part with echoes of old laughter, 
Of moments etched, now fading after.
The roads once worn by feet we knew,
 Now silent paths, their colors few.

The treasures held in hands once warm, 
Slip through like mist before a storm.
We leave behind the dreams we spun, 
Now scattered light beneath the sun.
Yet still, within the heart they stay, 
The ghosts of love that slip away. 
Though time may steal, and distance grow, 
What's left is all we'll ever know..

    story: `
    While the others were still holding their stand with all their willpower against organic chemistry in the night prep before chemistry exam, I had already given up and started doodling. It suddenly came to me that I needed a change of pace in the typical schedule and the first thing coming to my mind was a tour. As I announced it to the class hoping to find some companions, a lot of hands were raised but most with conditions like getting A+ or without failing in the exam. So, on the first day of winter vacation, it was just the 4 of us heading towards the bus stand for Parchagarh. The main thrill was that we didn't know anything about the place, had no relatives, were not sure where to stay and with whatever amount of cash we could manage which combinedly was almost negligible for a tour. But that wasn’t enough to stop us, and like that we took a bus and had reached the ‘Zero Point’ by 3 o’clock. There a local van driver offered to show us around the area and one by one we visited the tea gardens, border areas and the areas around Banglabandha. By this time, we had already enjoyed to the fullest and dicked more pictures than we should have. As the sky got darker, the tension of where to spend the night had started to build up but the van driver relived us by suggesting house guest system and took us to one of his known houses. While we all agreed it was risky to stay in someone's house without knowing them but the thrill of it got the better of us. Later, we realized that it saved us a lot of hassle. Though finding a place for us to stay at night relived us, our adventurous minds weren't ready to sit idle. So, at night we got out to explore the night city. As the excitement of adventure was still on, the simplest of the things felt extraordinary, with the cold freezing our bones and ice-cream giving us brain freeze. As the night grew colder we started to feel hungry and that was the moment we realized that except some tea, chips and ice cream we hadn't eaten anything since morning. And so we took porota with some vegetable and lentil. The food tasted phenomenal; just as they said, "Hunger is the best sauce." Eventually after much adventure we finally went to sleep in our rented house, even though it couldn't be called sleep because the risk of not being able to wake up at time the next morning haunted us the whole night. However, by the time we got ready the next morning, it was still dark. We started towards Bangalow, a prominent spot for watching Kanchanjanga. We reached the spot about 20 minutes prior to sunrise. As we shivered in cold, one of us bought 4 ice creams and with a prideful look an his face he said, "Set a thief, to catch a thief" and after processing for a second, we all burst out in laughter. Right beside us, there was a woman gathering dry leaves to light fire so we joined her as it was cold. Our plan to escape from cold using cold (ice-cream) ironically went in vain and we had to drink tea to clear the brain freeze. Eventually, as the fog started to fade, everything became visible. With a tea cup in hand and the Shiliguri bridge at our right, we finally saw the snowy white peak of Kanchanjanga peaking at us from 160 km away. In the early light, the second highest peak of the world glowed like a dazzling crystal. It was difficult to leave behind the hypnotysing beauty but the urge to go home was dominating So by 9am we were on our way home from Panchagarh with a whole new enthusiasm for adventure and a great story to tell.

    In 1964 Catherine Genovese an American woman who was returning late from work, was viciously attacked and sexually assaulted while walking home to her apartment complex from a nearby parking lot .As reported in the “New York Times” two weeks later, for over half an hour 38 respectable, law abiding people heard or saw the man attacking her three separate times . None of the 38 witnesses called the police during the attack , and only one bystander contacted authorities after kitty Genovese died such a case was also seen in the incident of 16 years old khaasen Morris on September 17, 2019 ; when he was stabbed to death in a violent brawl outside a ship mall. The horrific nature of his murder was amplified by the fact that the brawl occurred in broad daylight and was filmed by around 50 teenagers.No one intervened to assist the 16 year old .The ignorant attitude of the witnesses in these cases can be explained buy a social phenomenon known as the bystander effect.

    Bystander effect is the inhibiting influence of the presence of others on a person’s willingness to help someone in need. Research has shown that event in an emergency a bystander is less likely to extend help when he or she is in the real or imagined presence of others than when he or she is alone. That is more bytanders lead to less assistance with each additional bystander having a diminishing impact on helping .The seminal research on bystander intervention was conducted by American Social psychologist Bibb latane and John Darley, who found that bystanders do care about those in need of support and help , but often do no offer help. According to them before helping another, bystander goes through a 5 step decision making process. He must notice that something is wrong, define the situation as an emergency, decide whether he or she is personally responsible to act, choose how to help finally implement the chosen helping behavior failing to notice define decide choose and implement leads a bystander to turn a blind eye. Consistent with social comparison theory the effect of others is highlighted when the situation is more unclear .For example , when other people act calmly in the presence of potential emergency because they are unsure of what the event means ,bystanders may not interpret the situation as an emergency and thus act as it nothing happened. This leads to a chain of bystanders concluding that no action is needed .A phenomenon known as plaratic ignorance .Leading to diffusion of responsibilities. Diffusion of responsibilities refer to the decrease of person al responsibility felt by a bystander with the increase of bystanders. As a consequence so does his or her tendency to help.
    
    In this respect .When we notice a situation and define it as one requiring assistance .We must decide to take responsibility onto our shoulders. Obviously in the grand scheme of events .We are not quite the "innocent bystanders" we think of ourselves to be, are we?

    The Spiritual 36 July

The 36th July, a date that had never been seen in the world's calendar but would forever be etched in the hearts of every Bangladeshi. On this day a battle was fought not with weapons, but with the power of unity hope and a unshakable will to rise above adversity
The spiritual 36th July, it is not only a name, rather truly an event engaged with souls and spirits. Many Souls have been sacrificed for this victory. To really get the spiritual influence of Bengalis over this day, the story of martyrs is a must. Mir Mugdho was one of those martyrs.
The date was 18 July 2024. Mugdho, influenced by the flames of protest burning inside him like others, participated in the movement. Brave enough, he advanced for helping his fellow comrades with biscuits and water. He shouted amidst the crowd, "Water, water. Does anyone need water ?" Just like the street hawker he went on as a hawker of humanity. He contributed to the protest not by showing violence but by the act of kindness, Innocent yet guilty to the tyrants he was shot on the forehead while crossing a road barricade in Uttara. His friend Naimur Rahman Ashiq was by his side when he got martyred. Later, his friend told in an interview that Mugdho completed graduation in Mathematics from Khulna University. He was studying M.B.A in BUP and preparing for IELTS. Mugdho wanted to go abroad for higher studies. His friend told that Mugdho was a life full of promises cut short. Actually, Mugdho isn't a life cut short but a life that will be prolonged for centuries. He will live in the spirits of Bengalis as an idol.
Not only martyr Mugdho but the spirit of thousand martyrs ignited the second independence of Bangladesh on 36th July. The story of 36th July is a symbol of Bangladesh's indomitable spirit, echoing the country's legacy of resilience and collective action in the face of injustice. Twinning with the date 21 February of 1952 the 36th July of 2024 held a high position in the history of our nation.

 Life whispers softly, yet its grip is steel,
A tapestry of triumphs and wounds left to heal
 Each step we take, a dance through pain
 With skies of sunshine and storms of rain.

The struggles rise like mountains steep,
 In the quiet hours, they make us weep. 
A dream deferred, a heart betrayed, 
The price we pay for paths life laid.

But oh, the beauty in the fight,
The dawn that follows the longest night. 
In every tear, a seed is sown,
From shattered pieces, we've always grown.

The child who stumbles, learns to stand, 
The broken heart finds strength unplanned.
 The hands that trembled with steady still, 
The quiet soul that bends life to will.

For pain is a sculptor, chipping away, 
Revealing the masterpiece in the clay.
Through fire and pressure, we take our form,
 Emerging a new from each passing storm.

So wear your scars like a crown of gold,
 Each line a story, each wrinkle bold. 
The struggles are lessons, the pain a guide, 
To uncharted depths where our truths reside.

Though life is heavy, it's also divine, 
A symphony flawed, yet it is utterly fine. 
We are both the burden and the flight, 
The darkest shadows, the brightest lights.

In fact.They have faced different lawsuits for "Apparent egregious violations of the animal welfare Act as per CNN business. Besides, the possible long term effects of Having a Neuralink brain implant are not fully understood.which could include changes incognition, personality or mood. There are also concerns about privacy and data securitory of the people receiving these implants, as regards to how this data will be protected. This also comes as at a time when AI is going through exponential development with time with 20 million jobs are expected to be replaced by machines by 2030, making up 8.5% of the global manufacturing workforce; according to a 2019 study by Oxford Economics.Experts are increasingly concerned by AI taking control of our minds.
    
    With Neurolink in the spotlight today, we must not forget that there are several other companies carrying out similar experiments In fact, research about brain chips started as early as 1976, when researchers at the NIH made action potential recordings of signals Is from rhesus monkey motor cortexes using immorable "haptin"electrodes. So, Neuralink isn't the first company to be associated with brain chip development, and they definitely won't be the last. So while evaluating the possible implications of this brain chip, we must brace ourselves for the unprdictable future.
