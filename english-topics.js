    title: "A Girl Named Hope",
    story: `
    Life of Alie was not interesting enough to turn into a story. But it was good enough. After all, you don't find happiness only within the pages of a writer. She had more than she could ask for. Loving parents, a modest household, a small cultivating field. Mother nature was kind enough to never let them starve. But still listening to the lullabies of her mother and the stories of her distant past, she dreamt of herself, a princess, and her Prince charming on a white horse. But as the time went on and the little girl slowly turned into a lady, the wild fantasies had all but faded away from her mind. So when her Prince Charming finally appeared while riding on a bicycle instead of his white horse, she was caught unprepared. His name was Jose, the son of a humble businessman, not a king. Apparently, their fathers were distant family friends. Jose and Alie's simple mutual interest slowly turned to love and not long after th ey were married. By then, war was already brewing within their country Palestine, though the young couple were blissfully ignorant.

    marriage Six months had passed since their marraige and the war was getting worse. Miles away from her home in her in-law's place, Alie was terrified of the brutalities. She clung onto her family, afraid of letti- ng them go. But a wife's sweet words aren't always enough to quell the boiling blood of a young man like Jose. Thus, despite all her plights, Jose was too stubborn as he joined Hamas. The only thing she could do was watch him go and pray that he came back.
    
    News of her pregnancy was confirmed only aftera fews days of her departure Seven months had pass ed without any words from Jose. So when she he- ard Jose's letter had arrived.she ran toward the post office at her own. But what awaited her not a a letter of Jose, but one of his commander, writing to her about his glorious death. She broke down as this glory meant nothing to her. She felt that unimaginable lose. And the misfortune didn't come back alone. As soon as she got up to leave, a loud noise came to her ears and the next thing she knew.her in laws house was gone, along with everyone who was inside.
    
    The war was partial to none. Like thousands of other women all over Palestine. Alie roamed around aimlessly. By the time she heard of her hometown that had been blown up and her missing parents, she felt nothing as her heart had alread y turned to stone. When her water broke during the ninth month, the only places others could afford for her was a temporary hospital for the war refugees. Coincidentally, a ceasefire was called that day. And in this apocalyptic world, that seemed nothing less than a miracle to Allie. When she co ud finally move after her delivery, the nurse came and put a cute little angel on her lap. The sun was high up but the little girl seemed to outshine its brightness. She marveled at the new life born from her and became Allie's own anchor to this lonely earth. After a long time. she smiled. Thoug h still afraid. She started to weave new stories for the uncertain future.
    
    The girl was thus named "Hope"

    story: `
    In this kingdom of wax, a lonely night,
    Stand a thousand candles, waiting to ignite.
    A flick of ember is all it takes
    To enlighten the world and make it awake.
    But, the ember, it's something divine. 
    Blessing only few, to make them shine.
    
    
    On a sudden a blaze went past, 
    The chosen ones lightened, all in a haste
    Murky at places and some steep as a hill.
    Yet, Illuminating the town, they stood still.
    
    
    But whilst the of light is felt 
    The chosen one begins to melt. 
    Staying on firm in its fight,
    It gets engulfed in eternal plight.
    The candle now burnt to its wick 
    Is now gone, with the future bleak:
    
    
    In this kingdom of wax, a lonely night.
    The ignorant candle stand upright:
    While the chosen ones face their demise

    title: "NEOM City:The Future of Architecture?",
    story: `
    Now argubly the world's largest and most controve Consultant Eye Sareesial architectural project. NEOM is a futuristic urban project in Saudi Arabia. It will not be just a single city, rather a multiple area that will contain large regions

    As per "Dezeen, encompassing an area of around 26500 sq. km in northwestern Saudi Arabia it is a part of the Saudi Vision 2030 plan to diversify the countries economy to reduce its dependence on oil According to The ArchDaily," among 10 expected projects.details of 4 have been announced. This includes The Line, a 170 km linear city that will be construc- ted with two parallel, 500 m high linear skyscrapers standing 200 m apart with the bulldings clad with mirror facades Running from east to west across the Neom region on a footprint of just 34 sq km, it is expected to house 9 million by 2045. Furthermore there's oxagon an octagon shaped part city that will be built on the Red Sea. The logistics hub will be the world's largest floating structure. There is Trojena, a ski re- sort in the Sarwat Mountains and Sindala a 840,000 sq.m island resort within the Red Sea.
    
    As per "Research Gate "NEOM aims to be a global hub for various sectors, such as business.entertain ment, technology and tourism. The city is expected to offer world class quality of life, unparalleled social an deconomic experimentation and a place to prototype businesses, all built around humans, not technology. This project will be developed with a nature friendly approch and it is expected to be powered by 100%. renewable energy
    
    
    However surrounding the hype regaring this fantastic mega project, there are some controversies concerning sustainability.liveability and human rights.The area set to be developed is the historic homeland of the Huwaitat tribe. According to "Dezeen" it is estimated that around 20,000 tribe members will be relocated for this project. NEOM's developers have been critisized for the expected release of embodied carbon due to the project. Philip old field of the University of New South Wales has estimated that upwards of 1.8 billion tonnes of embodied CO₂ will be produced Experts are also concerned about the mirror facades impact on animal and bird life. Further more human right's experts have expressed suspicion about the smart city's surveillance and data collection.
    
    In retrospect, NEOM smart city is an innovative project that has possible implications on the socio-cultural, economical and technological dynamics of not only Saudi Arabia, but that of of world trade as a whole. However the implications being far-reaching he must consider our moral ethics before considering NEOM city as the ideal architectural model for the future.

    There was something intriguing about the vas  e The cracks, instead of being glued together seemed to have been covered with a layer of gold. Out of curiosity she asked, "Why has the pot been fixed in such a way? It seems like th e cracks are being highlighted."Rafi replied. "It's the japanese art of Kintsugi where the pieces of molten gold are attached with the pot to adorn them."Neela looked at Rafi and noticed his prosthetic leg. "Cracks? Asin flaws ?"she thought. To the surprise of Rafi,she chuckled for a moment and said, "You're right Rafi. The vase is shining and beautiful Just like you.

    title: "Innocent Bystanders",
    story: `
    In 1964 Catherine Genovese an American woman who was returning late from work, was viciously attacked and sexually assaulted while walking home to her apartment complex from a nearby parking lot .As reported in the “New York Times” two weeks later, for over half an hour 38 respectable, law abiding people heard or saw the man attacking her three separate times . None of the 38 witnesses called the police during the attack , and only one bystander contacted authorities after kitty Genovese died such a case was also seen in the incident of 16 years old khaasen Morris on September 17, 2019 ; when he was stabbed to death in a violent brawl outside a ship mall. The horrific nature of his murder was amplified by the fact that the brawl occurred in broad daylight and was filmed by around 50 teenagers.No one intervened to assist the 16 year old .The ignorant attitude of the witnesses in these cases can be explained buy a social phenomenon known as the bystander effect.

    Bystander effect is the inhibiting influence of the presence of others on a person’s willingness to help someone in need. Research has shown that event in an emergency a bystander is less likely to extend help when he or she is in the real or imagined presence of others than when he or she is alone. That is more bytanders lead to less assistance with each additional bystander having a diminishing impact on helping .The seminal research on bystander intervention was conducted by American Social psychologist Bibb latane and John Darley, who found that bystanders do care about those in need of support and help , but often do no offer help. According to them before helping another, bystander goes through a 5 step decision making process. He must notice that something is wrong, define the situation as an emergency, decide whether he or she is personally responsible to act, choose how to help finally implement the chosen helping behavior failing to notice define decide choose and implement leads a bystander to turn a blind eye. Consistent with social comparison theory the effect of others is highlighted when the situation is more unclear .For example , when other people act calmly in the presence of potential emergency because they are unsure of what the event means ,bystanders may not interpret the situation as an emergency and thus act as it nothing happened. This leads to a chain of bystanders concluding that no action is needed .A phenomenon known as plaratic ignorance .Leading to diffusion of responsibilities. Diffusion of responsibilities refer to the decrease of person al responsibility felt by a bystander with the increase of bystanders. As a consequence so does his or her tendency to help.
    
    In this respect .When we notice a situation and define it as one requiring assistance .We must decide to take responsibility onto our shoulders. Obviously in the grand scheme of events .We are not quite the "innocent bystanders" we think of ourselves to be, are we?

    title: "Shrinking Bubbles",
    story: `
    The he bubble kept shrinking.And now, there is hardly any space left for more than three people or so I can almost touch the bubble wall if I reach out with my hand.


    [1 June,2018]
    
    If I had to say so, I considered myself a person with quite a good social circle: family, friends, relatives. It was a good life, until that happened.One day, I don't know when or how a bubble appeared. I could see the bubble's wall around me, Though I couldn't reach it. So, I came to a condusion I was at the centre of the bubble and it moved along with me. It was weird but I decided to keep it a secret for now.
    
    
    [3 June, 2018]
    
    The bubble has shrunk a lot this week. It is shrinking faster than before. What is this bubble? Why did it have to appear exactly now? No, maybe I am asking the wrong questions. Maybe the bubble was already there long ago; it was just too far away for me to see.
    
    
    [10 June, 2018]
    
    It shrunk more this week. It's now just as bigas my classroom. Within this time period, I found about something about this bubble. My voice can't reach outside the walls, it seems. Also, anyone outside it acts like they forgot about me.1 am getting worried a lot. I talked a lot to my dad.but I don't think he believes it. So my fear keeps rising. What if the shrinking never stops?
    
    
    [25th June, 2018]
    
    The space looks so small now that's suffocating.No one stays inside anymore.Unless they sit beside me. Yesterday, we wrote an essay on "My Best Friend".I looked at my best friend. Tom's notebook. He didn't write my name on the essay. It hurts.
    
    
    [1st July-2018]
    
    There's a good news. The bubble has stoppeds shrinking at last. But the problem is, it's so small now that no one could get in. It's lonely being invisible. I still have my meals at home and I still go to school. But I don't talk: or rather,no one talks to me. When someone gets too close, faint recognition is seen there, but weak wall goes away quickly.
    
    
    [17 July,2018]
    
    The road's relatively less busy today. While crossing the road.A white car came in front of me and white light washes over my face. The thing I remember is. I am lying over beside the road and strangers bend over curiously to look at me. My time's running out but my mind is sm iling because the bubble has burst. They can see me now. I will be gone but at last they'll know that I was here. I'm not lonely to death. I'm not invisible, I'm free.

According to "Tomorrow Bio, Newralink alms to develop high-bandwidth, brain-machine nterfaces that are capable of linking the human brain to external devices and Al systems. The implant itself is called "The Link a considered chip which is surgically embedded under the skull, where it receives imformation from Neural threads that ton out info diff- erent sections of a subjects brain in control of motor skills. By establishing this connectio- n with the brain, Neuralink seeks to enhan- ce human cognitive abilities address variou s neurological disorders like epilepsy, parkin son's disease, depresson and schizophenia,by altering neuronal activity in specific ways. Their brain chip came into the limelight when they released a video of a monkey playing the video game "Pong" with its mind only. They h ave leapt a huge stride forward last month on 29th January, 2024 when they announced that they had implanted a cheap in a human for th e very first time with this, Musk's ambitious plan to let humans wirelessly connect their brains with phones and other devices has achieved a breakthrough.

    However Neuralink hasn't been able to steer clear off controversaries. As reported in the "Guardian, Neuralink has faced federal inquiry after killing 1500 animals in testing. In fact.They have faced different lawsuits for "Apparent egregious violations of the animal welfare Act as per CNN business. Besides, the possible long term effects of Having a Neuralink brain implant are not fully understood.which could include changes incognition, personality or mood. There are also concerns about privacy and data securitory of the people receiving these implants, as regards to how this data will be protected. This also comes as at a time when AI is going through exponential development with time with 20 million jobs are expected to be replaced by machines by 2030, making up 8.5% of the global manufacturing workforce; according to a 2019 study by Oxford Economics.Experts are increasingly concerned by AI taking control of our minds.
    
    With Neurolink in the spotlight today, we must not forget that there are several other companies carrying out similar experiments In fact, research about brain chips started as early as 1976, when researchers at the NIH made action potential recordings of signals Is from rhesus monkey motor cortexes using immorable "haptin"electrodes. So, Neuralink isn't the first company to be associated with brain chip development, and they definitely won't be the last. So while evaluating the possible implications of this brain chip, we must brace ourselves for the unprdictable future.
