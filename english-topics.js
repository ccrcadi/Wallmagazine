    title: "The God Particle",
    story: `
    The Higgs Boson is one of the most important unanswered mysteries in the realm of physics. Theoretically, it is said to be a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, but deep down, it has some extraordinary characteristics, which might play a vital role in unraveling several unknown secrets of physics, particularly particle physics. The first research regarding the Higgs Boson had been conducted at CERN in the 1960s. From then, several experiments were carried out by scientists and organisations. all over the world. Finally, after 40 years of extensive research, in 2012, from several experiments carried out by the CMS and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, a sub atomic particle with the expected properties similar to Higgs Boson was discovered. For this discovery, in 2013, physicists Peter Higgs and Francois Englert were awarded the Nobel prize in physics. Now lets look into the characteristics and properties of the Higgs Boson. Its mass has been measured 125 giga electron volts approximately, which is similar to the predictions of the Standard Model. Now another question arises that, what is the standard Model? In physics, the Standard Model is a widely accepted frame work ,based on quantum field theory, that predicts almost all known particles and forces aside from gravity with great accuracy. In the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is actually a massive scalar boson. Its special characteristics include:
•Zero Spin
•Even parity (positive) 
•No electric charge
•No colour charge
Another mentionable property includes that the Higgs Boson is a very unstable particle, which decays very quickly into various particles like pairs of photons, W and Z bosons, fermions etc. In the PRL papers written in 1964, Peter Higgs also mentioned in the closing sentence that, "An essential feature is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons". Before these discoveries, in the 1980s, there arose a question among the then physicists about the existence of a field named the Higgs field, on which the Standard Model was based on. So, during that time, this issue about the existence of the Higgs field become the last unverified part of the standard Model, which was considered as "The central problem in particle physics" for several decades. After decades of extensive research, the scientists gave several key predictions, among which, one was that a matching particle, called the "Higgs Boson" should also exist, whose existence would have also proved the existence of the Higgs field was theorised as a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components, having a Sombrero potential unlike any other fields. The significance of the discovery of the Higgs Boson is immense. It includes: 

•Cosmic Inflation
•Authenticity of the Standard Model
•Proof of the scalar fields like Higgs field 
•Symmetry breaking.
Although still theoretical, the discovery of the, Higgs Boson is a milestone in the realm of particle physics. Through this discovery, a way has been paved for the scientists to explore more about the funda mental structure of the universe and answer that un solved mysteries of physics. Following this discovery, through further extensive search and experiments, many new theories and discoveries will be ab- le to present a more comprehensible and advanced explanation regarding several matters of physics and cosmology to mankind.

    story: `
    Are some people meant to suffer?
 Living out like a loser
Can’t they rise again?
 To bargain
What was taken away from them

They were the dreamers
Dreaming like a new comer 
With hundreds of possibilities, 
Dreamt a new kid
 But seeing the truth of life 
He closed his eyelids.

Those eyelids never opened again 
Because life didn't give him
 What he chose to gain
They said they accepted beauty
But never accepted dreams of every nature
Although they say,
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.

Alas! they didn't have eyes
For which they had to hide the kid
Under their lies.

They didn't have eyes
That's why they didn't have to close their eyelids 
But, was it the fault of the new kid?
Choosing something out of their bid?

    title: "NEOM City:The Future of Architecture?",
    story: `
    Now argubly the world's largest and most controve Consultant Eye Sareesial architectural project. NEOM is a futuristic urban project in Saudi Arabia. It will not be just a single city, rather a multiple area that will contain large regions

    As per "Dezeen, encompassing an area of around 26500 sq. km in northwestern Saudi Arabia it is a part of the Saudi Vision 2030 plan to diversify the countries economy to reduce its dependence on oil According to The ArchDaily," among 10 expected projects.details of 4 have been announced. This includes The Line, a 170 km linear city that will be construc- ted with two parallel, 500 m high linear skyscrapers standing 200 m apart with the bulldings clad with mirror facades Running from east to west across the Neom region on a footprint of just 34 sq km, it is expected to house 9 million by 2045. Furthermore there's oxagon an octagon shaped part city that will be built on the Red Sea. The logistics hub will be the world's largest floating structure. There is Trojena, a ski re- sort in the Sarwat Mountains and Sindala a 840,000 sq.m island resort within the Red Sea.
    
    As per "Research Gate "NEOM aims to be a global hub for various sectors, such as business.entertain ment, technology and tourism. The city is expected to offer world class quality of life, unparalleled social an deconomic experimentation and a place to prototype businesses, all built around humans, not technology. This project will be developed with a nature friendly approch and it is expected to be powered by 100%. renewable energy
    
    
    However surrounding the hype regaring this fantastic mega project, there are some controversies concerning sustainability.liveability and human rights.The area set to be developed is the historic homeland of the Huwaitat tribe. According to "Dezeen" it is estimated that around 20,000 tribe members will be relocated for this project. NEOM's developers have been critisized for the expected release of embodied carbon due to the project. Philip old field of the University of New South Wales has estimated that upwards of 1.8 billion tonnes of embodied CO₂ will be produced Experts are also concerned about the mirror facades impact on animal and bird life. Further more human right's experts have expressed suspicion about the smart city's surveillance and data collection.
    
    In retrospect, NEOM smart city is an innovative project that has possible implications on the socio-cultural, economical and technological dynamics of not only Saudi Arabia, but that of of world trade as a whole. However the implications being far-reaching he must consider our moral ethics before considering NEOM city as the ideal architectural model for the future.

    story: `
    We part with echoes of old laughter, 
Of moments etched, now fading after.
The roads once worn by feet we knew,
 Now silent paths, their colors few.

The treasures held in hands once warm, 
Slip through like mist before a storm.
We leave behind the dreams we spun, 
Now scattered light beneath the sun.
Yet still, within the heart they stay, 
The ghosts of love that slip away. 
Though time may steal, and distance grow, 
What's left is all we'll ever know..

    title: "Sunshine’s Peak",
    story: `
    While the others were still holding their stand with all their willpower against organic chemistry in the night prep before chemistry exam, I had already given up and started doodling. It suddenly came to me that I needed a change of pace in the typical schedule and the first thing coming to my mind was a tour. As I announced it to the class hoping to find some companions, a lot of hands were raised but most with conditions like getting A+ or without failing in the exam. So, on the first day of winter vacation, it was just the 4 of us heading towards the bus stand for Parchagarh. The main thrill was that we didn't know anything about the place, had no relatives, were not sure where to stay and with whatever amount of cash we could manage which combinedly was almost negligible for a tour. But that wasn’t enough to stop us, and like that we took a bus and had reached the ‘Zero Point’ by 3 o’clock. There a local van driver offered to show us around the area and one by one we visited the tea gardens, border areas and the areas around Banglabandha. By this time, we had already enjoyed to the fullest and dicked more pictures than we should have. As the sky got darker, the tension of where to spend the night had started to build up but the van driver relived us by suggesting house guest system and took us to one of his known houses. While we all agreed it was risky to stay in someone's house without knowing them but the thrill of it got the better of us. Later, we realized that it saved us a lot of hassle. Though finding a place for us to stay at night relived us, our adventurous minds weren't ready to sit idle. So, at night we got out to explore the night city. As the excitement of adventure was still on, the simplest of the things felt extraordinary, with the cold freezing our bones and ice-cream giving us brain freeze. As the night grew colder we started to feel hungry and that was the moment we realized that except some tea, chips and ice cream we hadn't eaten anything since morning. And so we took porota with some vegetable and lentil. The food tasted phenomenal; just as they said, "Hunger is the best sauce." Eventually after much adventure we finally went to sleep in our rented house, even though it couldn't be called sleep because the risk of not being able to wake up at time the next morning haunted us the whole night. However, by the time we got ready the next morning, it was still dark. We started towards Bangalow, a prominent spot for watching Kanchanjanga. We reached the spot about 20 minutes prior to sunrise. As we shivered in cold, one of us bought 4 ice creams and with a prideful look an his face he said, "Set a thief, to catch a thief" and after processing for a second, we all burst out in laughter. Right beside us, there was a woman gathering dry leaves to light fire so we joined her as it was cold. Our plan to escape from cold using cold (ice-cream) ironically went in vain and we had to drink tea to clear the brain freeze. Eventually, as the fog started to fade, everything became visible. With a tea cup in hand and the Shiliguri bridge at our right, we finally saw the snowy white peak of Kanchanjanga peaking at us from 160 km away. In the early light, the second highest peak of the world glowed like a dazzling crystal. It was difficult to leave behind the hypnotysing beauty but the urge to go home was dominating So by 9am we were on our way home from Panchagarh with a whole new enthusiasm for adventure and a great story to tell.

    story: `
    In 1964 Catherine Genovese an American woman who was returning late from work, was viciously attacked and sexually assaulted while walking home to her apartment complex from a nearby parking lot .As reported in the “New York Times” two weeks later, for over half an hour 38 respectable, law abiding people heard or saw the man attacking her three separate times . None of the 38 witnesses called the police during the attack , and only one bystander contacted authorities after kitty Genovese died such a case was also seen in the incident of 16 years old khaasen Morris on September 17, 2019 ; when he was stabbed to death in a violent brawl outside a ship mall. The horrific nature of his murder was amplified by the fact that the brawl occurred in broad daylight and was filmed by around 50 teenagers.No one intervened to assist the 16 year old .The ignorant attitude of the witnesses in these cases can be explained buy a social phenomenon known as the bystander effect.

    Bystander effect is the inhibiting influence of the presence of others on a person’s willingness to help someone in need. Research has shown that event in an emergency a bystander is less likely to extend help when he or she is in the real or imagined presence of others than when he or she is alone. That is more bytanders lead to less assistance with each additional bystander having a diminishing impact on helping .The seminal research on bystander intervention was conducted by American Social psychologist Bibb latane and John Darley, who found that bystanders do care about those in need of support and help , but often do no offer help. According to them before helping another, bystander goes through a 5 step decision making process. He must notice that something is wrong, define the situation as an emergency, decide whether he or she is personally responsible to act, choose how to help finally implement the chosen helping behavior failing to notice define decide choose and implement leads a bystander to turn a blind eye. Consistent with social comparison theory the effect of others is highlighted when the situation is more unclear .For example , when other people act calmly in the presence of potential emergency because they are unsure of what the event means ,bystanders may not interpret the situation as an emergency and thus act as it nothing happened. This leads to a chain of bystanders concluding that no action is needed .A phenomenon known as plaratic ignorance .Leading to diffusion of responsibilities. Diffusion of responsibilities refer to the decrease of person al responsibility felt by a bystander with the increase of bystanders. As a consequence so does his or her tendency to help.
    
    In this respect .When we notice a situation and define it as one requiring assistance .We must decide to take responsibility onto our shoulders. Obviously in the grand scheme of events .We are not quite the "innocent bystanders" we think of ourselves to be, are we?

    title: "Shrinking Bubbles",
    story: `
    The he bubble kept shrinking.And now, there is hardly any space left for more than three people or so I can almost touch the bubble wall if I reach out with my hand.


    [1 June,2018]
    
    If I had to say so, I considered myself a person with quite a good social circle: family, friends, relatives. It was a good life, until that happened.One day, I don't know when or how a bubble appeared. I could see the bubble's wall around me, Though I couldn't reach it. So, I came to a condusion I was at the centre of the bubble and it moved along with me. It was weird but I decided to keep it a secret for now.
    
    
    [3 June, 2018]
    
    The bubble has shrunk a lot this week. It is shrinking faster than before. What is this bubble? Why did it have to appear exactly now? No, maybe I am asking the wrong questions. Maybe the bubble was already there long ago; it was just too far away for me to see.
    
    
    [10 June, 2018]
    
    It shrunk more this week. It's now just as bigas my classroom. Within this time period, I found about something about this bubble. My voice can't reach outside the walls, it seems. Also, anyone outside it acts like they forgot about me.1 am getting worried a lot. I talked a lot to my dad.but I don't think he believes it. So my fear keeps rising. What if the shrinking never stops?
    
    
    [25th June, 2018]
    
    The space looks so small now that's suffocating.No one stays inside anymore.Unless they sit beside me. Yesterday, we wrote an essay on "My Best Friend".I looked at my best friend. Tom's notebook. He didn't write my name on the essay. It hurts.
    
    
    [1st July-2018]
    
    There's a good news. The bubble has stoppeds shrinking at last. But the problem is, it's so small now that no one could get in. It's lonely being invisible. I still have my meals at home and I still go to school. But I don't talk: or rather,no one talks to me. When someone gets too close, faint recognition is seen there, but weak wall goes away quickly.
    
    
    [17 July,2018]
    
    The road's relatively less busy today. While crossing the road.A white car came in front of me and white light washes over my face. The thing I remember is. I am lying over beside the road and strangers bend over curiously to look at me. My time's running out but my mind is sm iling because the bubble has burst. They can see me now. I will be gone but at last they'll know that I was here. I'm not lonely to death. I'm not invisible, I'm free.

 Life whispers softly, yet its grip is steel,
A tapestry of triumphs and wounds left to heal
 Each step we take, a dance through pain
 With skies of sunshine and storms of rain.

The struggles rise like mountains steep,
 In the quiet hours, they make us weep. 
A dream deferred, a heart betrayed, 
The price we pay for paths life laid.

But oh, the beauty in the fight,
The dawn that follows the longest night. 
In every tear, a seed is sown,
From shattered pieces, we've always grown.

The child who stumbles, learns to stand, 
The broken heart finds strength unplanned.
 The hands that trembled with steady still, 
The quiet soul that bends life to will.

For pain is a sculptor, chipping away, 
Revealing the masterpiece in the clay.
Through fire and pressure, we take our form,
 Emerging a new from each passing storm.

So wear your scars like a crown of gold,
 Each line a story, each wrinkle bold. 
The struggles are lessons, the pain a guide, 
To uncharted depths where our truths reside.

Though life is heavy, it's also divine, 
A symphony flawed, yet it is utterly fine. 
We are both the burden and the flight, 
The darkest shadows, the brightest lights.

In fact.They have faced different lawsuits for "Apparent egregious violations of the animal welfare Act as per CNN business. Besides, the possible long term effects of Having a Neuralink brain implant are not fully understood.which could include changes incognition, personality or mood. There are also concerns about privacy and data securitory of the people receiving these implants, as regards to how this data will be protected. This also comes as at a time when AI is going through exponential development with time with 20 million jobs are expected to be replaced by machines by 2030, making up 8.5% of the global manufacturing workforce; according to a 2019 study by Oxford Economics.Experts are increasingly concerned by AI taking control of our minds.
    
    With Neurolink in the spotlight today, we must not forget that there are several other companies carrying out similar experiments In fact, research about brain chips started as early as 1976, when researchers at the NIH made action potential recordings of signals Is from rhesus monkey motor cortexes using immorable "haptin"electrodes. So, Neuralink isn't the first company to be associated with brain chip development, and they definitely won't be the last. So while evaluating the possible implications of this brain chip, we must brace ourselves for the unprdictable future.
